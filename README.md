# Engineering Standards

Canonical source of truth for software engineering patterns across projects and languages. Each reference project implements these patterns in a specific language/framework, guided by skills that codify the patterns as actionable rules.

## Reference Projects

| ID | Project | Language | Framework | Domain |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **java** | [spring-boot-testing-reference](https://github.com/alleato-llc/spring-boot-reference) | Java 25 | Spring Boot | Order management |
| **rust** | [rust-cli-reference](https://github.com/alleato-llc/rust-cli-reference) | Rust | CLI/TUI | Expense tracking |
| **swift** | [swift-ios-reference](https://github.com/alleato-llc/swift-ios-reference) | Swift 6.0 | SwiftUI/iOS | Recipe/meal planning |

## Skill Matrix

Skills are portable patterns that guide code generation. Each skill defines rules, code examples, and conventions for a specific concern. Skills follow [semantic versioning](VERSIONING.md). See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for what changed in each version. See [SKILL_AUTHORING.md](SKILL_AUTHORING.md) for the required structure and writing guidelines.

**Legend:** version = implemented at that version, — = not yet defined or implemented, N/A = not applicable

## Gaps and Priorities

### Portable skills missing from Rust CLI

1. **naming-conventions** — Formalize the `*Service`, `*Client`, `*Calculator`, `*Repository` suffixes
2. **configuration** — CLI args via `clap`, env var binding, config file support
3. **logging** — Structured logging via `tracing` crate

### Swift/iOS gaps

1. **logging** — OSLog/Logger conventions, subsystem + category pattern
2. **configuration** — App configuration, feature flags, environment-based settings

### Java/Spring Boot gaps

1. **persistence** — Covered by entity-design + flyway. Consider unified overview.

### Cross-cutting — not yet in any project

1. **input-validation** — Boundary validation rules, sanitization, reject vs coerce
2. **api-design** — URL shape, status codes, pagination, versioning, response conventions
3. **authentication** — JWT/OAuth2/API key patterns, middleware placement, accessing the authenticated user
4. **authorization** — Role/permission model, where checks live, resource-level access control
5. **secrets-management** — Extends configuration; vault integration, rotation, what never goes in code
6. **CI/CD** — Build, test, release pipeline patterns
7. **graceful-shutdown** — Startup/shutdown lifecycle patterns
